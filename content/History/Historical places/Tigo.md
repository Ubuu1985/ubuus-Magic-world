Destroyed in 2001 by [[The Order of Vorag]] for helping [[SEAD]].
[[Cloud Strife cod. nam.]] was blamed as the reason for the attack (due to his bosting) until the capture of [[General Osmond Enstone]] in 2019. The general confirmed that the village was going to be destroyed anyways.
In the center of town was a Marble Fountain and statue of the [[Gilda, Goddess of Prosperity]]. The statue had it's head and wings smashed off during [[General Osmond Enstone]]'s Destruction of the village.
