The Bangaa are a reptilian race living almost twice as long as Humans. Being a very socially and cognitively advanced race, they hate being called "lizards" as this is regarded as an offensive slur. Bangaa in are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Human society, and are the race most friendly with the latter. Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters. However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing. Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells. To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use. They are also said to be distantly related to lizard men.
